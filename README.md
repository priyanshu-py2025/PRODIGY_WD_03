# PRODIGY_WD_03
This project was developed as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It is a fully functional and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a fun, responsive, and engaging web-based game that demonstrates strong front-end development skills.
